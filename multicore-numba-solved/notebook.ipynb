    "## Multicore Parallelization of Matrix Multiplication Using Numba\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will be using Numba to accelerate matrix-matrix multiplications by exploiting parallelism. Even most laptops today have Multicore CPUs, where a *core* is a microprocessor, and each core is usually a copy of the each other core. Accelerating the marrix-matrix multiplication operation is a good analog to accelerating other types of operators and computationally intense kernels, codes, and algorithms. Furthermore, the structure of matricies makes matrix-matrix multiplication a good place start learning how to parallelize code.\n",

    "1. Does Amdahl's Law play a major factor in the performance differences? Which part of the matrix-matrix multiplication was not parallelized (serial portion)? (Hint: which matricies did we reuse for each function?) Could we parallelize this part, and if so, are there caveats?\n",
    "1. Do you think all codes should be parallelized? What about matrix-matrix multiplication? (This is a subjective question, but I am looking for a brief, but rational and informed arguement).\n",

    "1. Differences in performance come from the ability to keep values stored in the cache for the entire time that value is being used. The less efficient permutations repeatedly load and delete the same values from cache, while the more efficient permutations load each value into cache as few times as possible.\n",
    "2. numpy.dot is significantly faster than any of the permutations. This is because numpy.dot is highly optimized by professionals, who likely do things like divide up the problem into more than three loops that are the most efficient size for the system.\n",
    "3. The float32 operations were faster, which makes sense because less data needs to be moved to perform each suboperation. The speedup was roughly ~2.5x.\n",
    "4. Amdahl's law does play a major factor in performance differences. Allocating the memory for matrix C is completely serial, but could be parallelized by doing this within the second loop. Caveats include the difficulty in allocating this memory in a scalable way.\n",
    "5. I think that all codes that intend to deal with large datasets should be parallelized, including matrix-matrix multiplication. The time savings for data-intensive tasks are huge. However, for less data-intensive tasks, code should be more serial to improve ease of understanding and editing.\n"
