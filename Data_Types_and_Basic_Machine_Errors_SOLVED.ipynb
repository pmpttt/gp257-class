Due to the way signed integers are represented in binary, adding 1 to the maximum positive value gives the binary value for the maximum negative value. The python variables are stored without a specific amount of data, so when a value is at the maximum size for its amount of bits and is increased, python simply increases the number of bits assigned to the variable.\n",

An example of when you might encounter truncation errors is when solving integrals (a sequence of summations) on a computer. Given that we mostly work with computers that have finite precision arithematic, we must represent integrals as finite summations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate truncation errors we are going to sum all the integer values from $1$ to $N$, but were are going to represent each integer as a numpy.float32 type. In the cell below, I've writen a function that finds the analyical solution to $\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{N}i$, for a given $N$.\n",

    "* Next, you need to create function that calculates and returns the sum of this array (make it fast, and feel free to use numpy functions). Besure to verify that your sum is the same as the analytical sum. I suggest starting with an array of just 10 elements, so $N=10$.\n",
    "* Once you have verified that your sumation function is returning the correct results, you have two tasks:\n",
    "    1. Find the value of $N_{inc}$ at which your summation is no longer corret. Discuss in the markdown cell below how you found this value. \n",
    "    2. Write an improved summation that can correctly sum all the values to find the answer of $\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{2\\cdot N_{inc}}$ (the sum upto $2\\cdot N_{inc}$). Discuss your reasoning about how you chose to solve this task.\n",
    "    3. Special Case: If you are taking this course for 4-units, then write a recursive function recur_sum() that can solve problem 2. All values must remain as numpy.float32 values (no type-casting). Then test your fuction for $4\\cdot N_{inc}$ (it should be accurate without any changes, but if it's not, that's ok).\n",
